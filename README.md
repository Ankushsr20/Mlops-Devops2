# Mlops-Devops2
In this project, we can see the integration of Jenkins, Docker, Git, and GitHub with the help of the following objectives:

    Create a Docker container image that has Jenkins installed using Dockerfile. When we launch this image, it should automatically start the Jenkins service in the container.
    Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3, and job4 using the build pipeline plugin in Jenkins.
